# Product Vision

## Target Customer

Middle management and above at Norwegian companies that need to become more adaptable. Specifically leaders who are responsible for how teams and departments are organized — project leaders, product owners, CTOs, heads of development, and executive leadership. These are people who recognize something needs to change but lack the tools and frameworks to make it happen.

Existing clients include organizations like Avinor, Screen Media, and Defendable.

## Customer Problem

Companies don't have the organizational capabilities they need to respond to change. They don't know what their org design should look like, and they don't have the change management tools to get there. Transformation efforts often stall because they're too theoretical, too focused on team-level practices, or don't stick after the consultant leaves.

## Value Proposition

Smidigakademiet, led by Arne Henrik Storm, delivers strategic agile organizational design through practical, simulation-based learning and hands-on consulting. This is not team-level Scrum training — it's about building the organizational capability to continuously adapt. Storm brings deep subject matter expertise with a teaching style that is engaging, structured, and grounded in real-world application (including signature exercises like the Lego simulation).

## Key Benefits

- Organizations actually become adaptable — faster response to market shifts, better cross-team collaboration, less bureaucracy
- Leaders gain practical tools they can apply immediately, not abstract theory
- Training is tailored to the company's specific context and challenges
- Knowledge transfers to the organization so they're not dependent on external help long-term

## Product Principles

- **Skreddersym** — Everything is tailored. No generic off-the-shelf courses or cookie-cutter advice.
- **Humor** — Learning should be engaging and fun. Humor builds trust and makes concepts stick.
- **Faglig kompetanse** — Deep professional expertise backs everything. Credibility through knowledge, not buzzwords.
- **Apenhet og deling** — Share knowledge openly to build trust. Free content demonstrates expertise; paid services go deeper.

## Success Looks Like

Organizations that work with Smidigakademiet become genuinely adaptable. They can sense changes in their environment and respond without months of reorganization. Leaders have the confidence and practical skills to evolve their organizational design continuously. Storm becomes the go-to name in Norway for strategic agile organizational design.

## Website Purpose

The website is the primary way people find Storm and decide to reach out. It serves two conversion paths:

1. **Inbound inquiries** — Getting potential customers to make contact about **one-off tailored classes** (the most common entry point) or **longer consulting engagements** for organizational design work.
2. **Scheduled class sign-ups** — Storm runs scheduled, open classes that anyone can sign up for. The website handles the full flow: browsing upcoming classes, applying/registering, and receiving confirmation.

The site should build enough trust and demonstrate enough expertise that a visitor thinks "this is the guy I need to talk to" — whether they sign up for a scheduled class or reach out about something tailored. Free, open content (documentation, articles) serves this goal by showing depth of knowledge and driving organic traffic.

A longer-term ambition is an **online video course** — a way to scale beyond in-person delivery, reach a wider audience, and create recurring revenue. This is a dream worth designing for from the start, even if it launches later.

## Website Structure

1. **Landing page** — Clear value proposition, social proof (testimonials from Avinor, Defendable, etc.), and calls to action that drive contact and sign-ups
2. **About Storm** — Build trust and credibility through Storm's background, approach, and personality
3. **Scheduled classes** — Browse upcoming classes, register with Stripe payment, and receive automated confirmation and reminder emails
4. **Contact** — Low-friction way to get in touch for tailored class or consulting inquiries
5. **Discovery call booking** — Calendar integration so potential customers can book a call without email back-and-forth
6. **Email list / Newsletter** — Capture leads from visitors who aren't ready to buy yet. Occasional useful content keeps Storm top of mind until they are
7. **Testimonials** — Collect and display social proof. Easy submission flow after each class to keep gathering fresh testimonials
8. **Documentation / Knowledge base** — Open content that demonstrates expertise, helps others, and drives organic search traffic (SEO)
9. **Online course (future)** — Video-based course behind a paywall for scalable, location-independent revenue

## Existing Infrastructure

- **Stripe** — Already integrated for payment processing
- **Notion** — Used as CRM for tracking leads and client relationships (external to the website)

## Solo Company Considerations

This is a one-person company. Every feature should either **save Storm's time** or **generate revenue**. Automation is critical — manual admin work (sending confirmations, reminders, follow-ups, invoices) should be handled by the system wherever possible. The website should work as a sales and admin tool while Storm focuses on delivering classes and consulting.
